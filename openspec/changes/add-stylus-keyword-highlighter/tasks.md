## 1. Implementation
- [x] Create a single-file Stylus user-script with minimal UI overlay for highlight and exclude keyword input.
- [x] Persist highlight/exclude lists and color mapping in localStorage scoped by hostname.
- [x] Implement keyword highlighting and strike-through that handles dynamic navigation (e.g., Gmail) without full reload.
- [ ] Add basic usage instructions at the top of the script.

## 2. Validation
- [ ] Manual check on a dynamic page (e.g., Gmail) to confirm persistence and highlighting on navigation.
